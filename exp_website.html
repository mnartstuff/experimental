		<h5>Here is my first attempt at building a website. Before you point out that the 90s called and want their web esthetic back, let me point out that I am learning web design, and will update this site as a learn more.</h5>

		<p>I'm from the small town of Hancock, NH. It's the kind of place you'd expect to see on a postcard you'd send someone from your New England foliage tour. But I haven't spent me entire life there. At the age of twenty, I moved overseas and spent most of my adult life in Europe, living in France, Spain, the UK, and the Czech Republic. For the past year and a bit, I've been residing in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and working across the Mississippi river in Minneapolis. Here are a few photos of my adventures.</p>

		<p>Other than three years in Aberdeen, MD, when I was a young lad, I spent my childhood growing up in the Monadnock region of New Hampshire. It was a great place to grow up, out in the country, surrounded by forest and mountains. I developed a love of skiing, hiking and nature. It's also home to the <a href="https://hancocktownlibrarynh.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Hancock Town Library</a>, where my mother helps to organize the annual book sale.</p>

		<p>After Hancock, the place I lived in the longest would be Prague, capital of the Czech Republic. The photo above shows Prague Castle on the hill, and below it the <i>"Mala Strana,"</i> or "Lesser Town." I loved the vibrant theatre scene in the Czech Republic, and I was frequently involved in putting on plays with my friends, either acting, building sets, stage-managing or occasionally puppeteering. I also taught languages: English, Spanish and French. Theatre and languages are two passions of mine.</p>
		<aside>My last show in Prague was with <a href="https://catnipdivadlo.com/" target="_blank">CATNIP Divadlo</a>. You can also visit their website be clicking the logo below

		<p>Before moving to Prague, I lived in France for two years. I had a job as an English language teaching assistant at the <i>Universit&eacute; de Franche-Comt&eacute;</i> in the city of Besan&ccedil;on. It was a small city of about 100,000 people. I lived in the centre, which is very well preserved. A fortified city since pre-roman times, most of the defenses you can find there date to the seventeenth century, and were designed during the Thirty Years War by the military architect, Vauban.</p>

		<p>After moving to Minnesota, I started working for <a href="http://tigeroxpainting.com/" target="_blank">TigerOx Painting</a>. It's a small, family-style business of people who love old houses and like working on them. It was fun to learn, not just painting, but the holistic approach to preservation that the company takes. Just as fun are the spirited discussions and debates on everything from philosophy to history to folklore to basketball that regularly take place among this erudite group of craftspeople.</p>

		<p>This is my girlfriend. We have the same first name. She's an incredible, kind and generous human, and an inspiration to me every day. She also happens to be one of the most talented artists I can think of and makes wicked funky collages and collage-paintings. You can find her work of clothing and accessories from her <a href="https://theartofaprince.threadless.com/" target="_blank">Threadless shop</a>.</p>
